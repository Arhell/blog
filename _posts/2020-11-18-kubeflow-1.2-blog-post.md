## Special Message from Kubeflow Founders

Three years (!!) ago, we (Jeremy Lewi, Vish Kannan and David Aronchick) [stood on stage at Kubecon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3dVF5wWz-g) to introduce Kubeflow for the first time. We could not have possibly imagined what would have come about - thousands of GitHub stars, tens of thousands of commits and a community that has built the most flexible and scalable platform for machine learning. And, best of all, it’s not backed by an enormous company that requires you to “upgrade” in order to use it; we gave it all away for free! Here’s to everything you all have done and we could not be more excited about the NEXT three years (and the three years beyond that). Thank you!

## Announcing Kubeflow v1.2 release

The Kubeflow Community’s delivery of the Kubeflow 1.2 software release includes ~100 user requested enhancements to improve model building, training, tuning, ML pipelining and serving.  This post includes a Release Highlights Section, which details significant 1.2 features as contributed by the Kubeflow application working groups (WG), SIGs, and ecosystem partners.  The Kubeflow 1.2 [changelog](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/releases/tag/v1.2-rc.0) provides a quick view of the 1.2 deliveries.

The Release was validated, tested and documented by the developers, and the Release is now being validated, tested and documented by users, cloud providers and commercial support partners on popular platforms i.e. AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, etc.   The Community is working on a more sustainable approach to owning and maintaining test infrastructure.

For Release 1.2, AWS has built and contributed a shared test-infra, which provides WG owners with enough permissions to identify problems, and test proposed solutions to completion. Currently, most WGs (AutoML, Training-Operators, KFServing, Deployments, Manifests) have already migrated their tests on this solution. As a result, the test-infra blocking time has fallen significantly, which is good for users and contributors.

## Getting Involved

The Community continues to grow and we invite new users and contributors to join the Working Groups and Community Meetings. The following provides some helpful links to those looking to get involved with the Kubeflow Community:

If you have questions and/or run into issues, please leverage the Kubeflow Slack channel and/or submit bugs via [Kubeflow on GitHub](https://github.com/kubeflow).

## What’s next

The Community has started discussions on Kubeflow 1.3. Arrikto has agreed to lead the 1.3 Release Management process and the Community will continue to capture input from users and contributors as features are defined, developed and delivered. Onward and upward!

Overall benefit: Simplify process of creating a model when you have new data and new code

Overall description: Kubeflow Pipelines is a platform for building and deploying portable, scalable machine learning (ML) workflows based on containers.  The Kubeflow Pipelines platform consists of:

* A user interface (UI) for managing and tracking experiments, jobs, and runs.
* An engine for scheduling multi-step ML workflows.
* An SDK for defining and manipulating pipelines and components.
* Notebooks for interacting with the system using the SDK.

The following are the goals of Kubeflow Pipelines:

* End-to-end orchestration: enabling and simplifying the orchestration of machine learning pipelines.
* Easy experimentation: making it easy for you to try numerous ideas and techniques and manage your various trials/experiments.
* Easy re-use: enabling you to re-use components and pipelines to quickly create end-to-end solutions without having to rebuild each time

Kubeflow Pipelines is stabilizing over a few patch releases. At the same time, we made a lot of progress at standardizing the [pipeline IR (intermediate representation) ](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/api/v2alpha1/pipeline_spec.proto) which will serve as a unified pipeline definition for different execution engines.

#### Feature Name: Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton backend available

SIG Meeting Notes: [Model Management SIG Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2r1z5O4USpn3BW29-4blCoPueB3p2LAjvdKa97fT7U/edit?usp=sharing)

Overall description: The SIG was initiated to define and develop a Kubeflow solution for model management, which will make it easier to organize and find models and their artifacts.   In addition, several contributors are submitting proposals on how to define data types for ML model and data, with the goal of driving wider metadata standards, and interoperability of models between ML platforms, clouds, and frameworks.  The proposals are working to define an ontology for model and data types and tooling to search and organize that metadata. 

Proposals from Kubeflow Pipelines contributors, the Model Management SIG, Seldon and a MLSpec from David Aronchick (Azure) are under discussion.   Please find links to those proposals below:

* [ML Data in Kubeflow Pipelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YhnsMK_ktaeUKLS2XShocq4u2bcUCUcztT9rioRssOM/edit#)

SIG Meeting Notes: [https://bit.ly/2LyTh14](https://bit.ly/2LyTh14)

Slack channel: https://kubeflow.slack.com/archives/C01C9NPD15H

### Platform: AWS

Description: Better reliability, better testing coverage by enabling E2E tests for Kubeflow AWS deployment, [better Kubeflow notebook user experience](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/notebook-server/).

### Platform: IBM

Description: Pipelines and Security have been the key focus for Kubeflow on IBM Cloud for this release. On the Pipelines side, [Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton is available for deployment on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/ibm/pipelines/) and is included by default with Kubeflow deployment on IBM Cloud. On the security side, [we have enabled integration with IBM Cloud AppId](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/ibm/deploy/install-kubeflow/#multi-user-auth-enabled) as an authentication provider instead of Dex. When using AppID, it delegates the identity provider to IBM Cloud with builtin identity providers (Cloud Directory, SAML, social log-in with Google or Facebook etc.) or custom providers. Additionally for securing the [Kubeflow authentication with HTTPS we have provided integration instructions](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/ibm/deploy/authentication/) using the [IBM Cloud Network Load Balancer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-loadbalancer-about).

### Platform: GCP

Description: Better UX and reliability for installation and upgrade. Upgrade Cloud Config Connector in management cluster to latest.

### Platform: Azure

Description: We added[ instructions for deploying Kubeflow with multi-tenancy backed by Azure Active Directory](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/authentication-oidc/). Additionally, we documented the [steps to replace the Metadata store with a managed Azure MySQL datatabase instance](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/azuremysql/)..

### Platform: OpenShift

Description: Our focus for this release was to create the OpenShift stack that can install Kubeflow components on OpenShift 4.x . We architected the stack so users can pick and choose components they would like to install by adding or removing kustomizeConfig entries in the kfdef. Components currently supported are istio, single user pipeline, Jupyter notebooks with a custom Tensorflow notebook image, profile controller with custom image, Katib, pytorch and Tensorflow job operators and Seldon. You can install Kubeflow 1.2 on Openshift from the [Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.io/) community operator in OpenShift Catalog using the OpenShift [kfdef](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_openshift.v1.2.0.yaml). 

### Platform: MicroK8s

Description: Kubeflow is a built-in add-on to MicroK8s, and now includes Istio v1.5 as default.

### Platform: MiniKF

Description: MiniKF is currently testing with Kubeflow 1.2 and will provide an updated MiniKF version based after validation testing and documentation has completed.    Please find more information on MiniKF here: [https://www.arrikto.com/get-started/](https://www.arrikto.com/get-started/) . You can also find tutorials that will guide you through end-to-end data science examples here: [https://www.arrikto.com/tutorials](https://www.arrikto.com/tutorials)
